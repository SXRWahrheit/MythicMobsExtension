# Custom Entities:

## Mythic Parrot:

Bukkit's entity type name: "mythic_parrot" `/summon mythic_parrot` 
Custom parrot class for better handling of the cookie thing.



# Mechanics:



## MythicPlayers Module

##### `- settarget` (deprecated if you use patched 4.2 or MythicMobs 4.3 use `@crosshair` instead):
`selfnotarget=true/false(default)` set the players target to self if the player do not have a target at crosshair. Bit hacky workaround for skill not being triggered if no target is set.

With this module you can turn any player on your server into a MythicPlayer. With almost all abilities of a MythicMobs mob. But there are some limitations. Because a player is a player and not a mob its very important that you make all the mob yamls that will be used for player ++persistent++ otherwise it will break your server and because of that fact you can only use MythicMobs yamls that have persistent set to true. Well thats the only limit.

### ActivePlayer mechanic:
##### `- activeplayer{m=[MythicPlayerType]} @trigger ~onInteract`

Transform the targeted player into a mythicplayer.

+ `m=[MobType]` Any valid MythicMob configuration with persistent option enabled.
	
### NormalPlayer mechanic:
##### `- normalplayer @self`

Make the mythicplayer player a ordinary player again. No further options needed here.
		
### SetTarget mechanic:
##### `- settarget{snt=[boolean]`

This mechanic is used to update the crosshair target of the player.
+ `selfnotarget=snt=true/false(default)` If enabled the target of the player will be set to self. Thats a hacky workaround for skills not being triggered if no target is avail.
		
Example configuration for a full working MythicPlayer (Summon the PlayerMonkey and interact with it to turn into the MythicPlayer mob or damage the mob to be normal player):

Mob yaml file:

```yaml
PlayerMonkey:
  Type: villager

  Health: 20
  AIGoalSelectors:

  AITargetSelectors:

*special variables*
+ <target.l.*> are parsed within pstance with the block position of the location if there is a location targeter
+ <target.l.dx dy dz> to get the coordinates as double not the block position.
+ <target.meta.*> where * is the name of the metatag. If used with a location targeter the block metatags are used.
+ <mob.meta.*> where * is the name of the metaag. Ex: `<mob.meta.<trigger.uuid>` reteruns the value stored in casters triggers uuid tag if 
there is one.

+ `pfacedir=` true/false(default) Projectile object will face in movement direction.
+ `pfoff=` value(0.0 default) The front offset of the object. A value of -1.0 is about the center of the caster mob.
+ `targetable=` true/false(default) Create a metadata on the object called "nottargetable" useful for to exclude the entity from targeters.
+ `eyedir=` true/false(default) If eyedir is used. The projectile do not need a target. It will be shoot in the entities look direction.
+ `invis=` true/false(default) to apply invisible to the projectile.
+ `bounce=` true/false(default) if enabled the projectile bounce from the ground. only make sense if gravity is used and stoponground=false.
+ `bred=` 0.2f(default) the amount the bouncing velocity is reduced.
+ `onbounceskill=onbounce=ob=` skillname The skill that will be executed if the projectile hit the ground.
		
- **mythicorbitalprojectiles:**

## MetaMechanics & Conditions:

### setmeta mechchanic:
Set parsed(!) metadata for the target. You can use all variables that are avaible while the skill is executed.

##### `- setmeta{meta="tag=tagname;value=tagvalue;type=BOOLEAN/NUMERIC/STRING";usecaster=BOOLEAN}`
			
The tags "tag" and "value" can contain any mob variable. Example: `[- setmeta{meta=<target.uuid>} @self]` add the uuid of the target as metatag to the mob. You can also use values and types, but this is more for further purpose. Still you can go form them too. If usecaster is set to true the metatag is always set for the caster of the skill. No matter what targeter is used.
		
`- setmeta{meta="tag=lastdamagedentity;value=<trigger.uuid>;type=STRING"} @self ~onAttack`
			
This will set the lastdamagedentity tag of the mob to the victims uuid. It is possible to set a metadata of a block by using a location targeter. All blocks including air are valid.
		
### delmeta mechanic:

Delete a metatag from the targeted entity. Be aware, if you remove tags that are not added by yourself, might break something else!
		
##### `- delmeta{meta="tag=lastdamagedentity"} @self ~onCombatDrop`
			
This remove the lastdamagedentity tag if the mob stop fighting.
		
### hasmeta condition:

With this condition you can check any parsed meta. In its main purpose its a compare condition. Mean its a TargetConditions because it needs 2 entities. But by setting the cs tag (compareself) in the condition, you can choose if the target or the caster metas are checked. Its also possible to use a list of tags. All mob variables that are useable at the moment the skill is executed can be used. Use hasmetasimple if you only need ot check a single entry.

##### `- hasmeta{meta="tag=tagname;value=metavalue;type=BOOLEAN/NUMERIC/STRING";cs=true/false;action=true/false/cast/castinstead}`

##### `- hasmetasimple{tag=tagname;value=metavalue;type=BOOLEAN/NUMERIC/STRING;cs=true/false;action=true/false/cast/castinstead}`

Example: `- hasmeta{meta="tag=lastdamagedentity;value=<target.uuid>;type=STRING";cs=true;action=true}`
			
This will check the caster entity if it has the tag "lastdamagedentity" and if it contains the uuid of the target. If cs=false it would check the target entity. The following condition use a list. ATM it will meet the condition if only 1 of the tags match. This will be changed in the future.
		
Example: `- hasmeta{meta="tag=<target.uuid>||tag=<trigger.uuid>";cs=true;action=true}`
			
Checks if the caster mob have the tag target uuid or trigger.uuid.
			
The following example shows how to make it, that every entity can hit the villager only once. After that the entity have to interact with the villager do get removed and can hit him again one time:

## customteleport skill:
Advanced teleport mechanic. Use this to teleport from/to variable destinations with variable behaviors.

Options:
+ `destination=` MythicMobs targeter or vanilla targeter. Use "" that the targeter can be parsed.
+ `noise=n=` number, random point around the target
+ `teleportdelay=tdelay=td=` number, delay in ticks between teleportation (if more than 1)
+ `infrontof=front=f=` true/false, teleport in front of target (if target is a entity)
+ `returntostart=return=r=` true/false, if the source entity should return to its start position
+ `betweenlastentitysignal=bls=` signalname to be send to caster mob between the teleportations, where the trigger is the last entity (if target was an entity)
+ `betweennextentitysignal=bns=` signalname to be send to caster mob 
+ `ignoreowner=io=` true/false, if the owner of the caster mob should be ignored.
+ `maxtargets=mt=` number, the maximium number of targets.

Or use some variables in the destination targeter:

	- customteleport{destination="@Location{c=<mob.l.x>,<mob.l.y>,<mob.l.z>}"} @eir{r=40} ~onDamaged
  
```
	
	
## dropmythicitem skill:
	
Drop a mythicitem or a mythicdroptable.

Options:
+ `mythicitem=item=itemtype=type=t=i=` Internal name of the mythic item or the mythic droptable.
+ `amount=a=` the amount of the that will be dropped if a mythic item, the amount of droptable creation if a droptable.
+ `shuffle=true/false` if true the droptable itemlist will be shuffled by random.
	
`- dropmythicitem{item=MythicItem;a=1} @pir{r=20} ~onAttack`
	
This drop one MythicItem at all players in radius of 20 if the mob targets a entity. Additional, whenever this mechanic is called there is a
`MythicMobsExtItemDropEvent`called with the mythicmobs the trigger and the drop as an arraylist.



## customparticleline skill (for MythicMobs 4.1.0 or higher):

The same like the original but added vDestOffset & hDestOffset to adjust the targetlocation.
Use vDestOffset to adjust the height and use hDestOffset to adjust the x/z position. Use idoy true/false(default) = ignoredestoffsetyaw to ignore the yaw of the targetlocation. With this its possible to target a specific part of the entity.
	
`- customparticleline{particle=reddust;amount=5;color=#feff90;ys=2.5;vd=1.0;hd=-1.0;idoy=true;distanceBetween=0.5;tyo=1.25} @pir{r=10} ~onTimer:5`



## setthreattarget & clearthreattarget skill:

Use setthreattarget to clear the activemobs threattable and add {a=double} targeter to the threat. Default amount is 65536.
	
##### `- setthreattarget{a=11111} @p`
	
To clear the threattable and trigger the dropCombat Event use:
	
##### `- clearthreattarget @self`



## SwapSkill:

Swap location of caster and target. Use keeptargetyaw=kty false/true or keepcasteryaw=kcy false/true to keep the original direction or not.
	
##### `- swap{kty=true;kcy=false} @target`



## StunSkill:
	
Use this mechanic to stun the target. 
	
##### `- stun{duration=Ticks;facing=true/false;gravity=true/false;stopai=true/false} @target`
	
Where `duration=d=`how many ticks the target will be stunned and `facing=true/false` if yaw pitch of entity shall remain. `gravity=true/false` false(default) turn off gravity while the entity is stunned. In addition there is the **isstunned condition**. Look at Conditions. If stopai is used. The ai of the mob will be disabled while playing the stun and reapplied afterwards.
	


## CustomSummonSkill:

Use this mechanic to add ax,ay,az to the targetlocation. Use ranged value in amount option. Use leashtocaster(leash/lc) to leash the summoned mob
to the caster.
	
##### `- customsummon{a=2to20;type=mobname} @self`
	
Summon 2 to 20 mobs of type mobname.
	
##### `- customsummon{type=WITHER_SKELETON;amount=5;radius=4;ax=5;ay=1;az=2} @self`
	
This example do not check for a safeplace it will spawn the mob no matter if its in block or such. If you want to use safeplace add noise. Example:
	
##### `- customsummon{type=WITHER_SKELETON;amount=5;radius=4;noise=1;ax=5;ay=1;az=2} @self`
	
This example shows how to spawn mobs relative to the direction of the targeted mob:
	
##### `- customsummon{t=mobname;ued=true;ifb=1} @self`
	
`ued=useEyeDirection=EyeDirection;ifb=inFrontBlocks=inFront`
	
Use setowner (true/false) to set the owner to the mob which casted the custumsummon skill.
	
##### `- customsummon{t=mobname;setowner=true} @selflocation`
	
This summon the mob mobname and set its owner to the mob which casted the skill.
	
Use `tag` option to add a parsed string to the scoreboard of the summoned mob. Variables are allowed and are parsed.
	
##### `- customsummon{t=mobname;tag=<target.uuid>} @self`
	
This summon the mob mobname and add the uuid of the target to the summoned mobs scoreboard.
	
Use `invisible=inv` option to summon the mob invisible.



## OxygenSkill:

Use this mechanic to add oxygen to the LivingEntity.
	
##### `- oxygen{a=20} @self`
	
`a = amount =` the amount of oxygen that will be added. A player has a usual max air amount of 300. A amount of 20 gives about 1 bubble air.
	
	
	
## FeedSkill:

Add specific amount of food to the players foodlevel.
	
##### `- feed{a=1} @PIR{r=20}`

##### `- removepotion{t=ALL} @self`
##### `- removepotion{t=INVISIBILITY} @PIR{r=30}`
	
`t = type = p = potion =`ALL by default. Use "ALL" to remove all effects or use a single effect or a list like: `p=INVISIBILITY,SPEED,HEAL`

	

## CustomDamageSkill:

Use this mechanic for a temporary mythicmobs damage mechanic fix. See http://www.mythicmobs.net/index.php?threads/skill-damage-bypassed-armour.3373/ this thread for details of the issue.
	
##### `- customdamage{a=1to2;ia=false;pk=false;pi=false;iabs=false}`
+ `a = amount =` 1 by default. The amount of damage applied. 1 = 1/2 heart. Ranged amount possbile: 1to2
+ `ia = i = ignorearmor =` false by default. If the armor of the target should be ignored or not.
+ `pk = pkb = preventknockback =` false by default. If knockback should be applied or not.
+ `pi = preventimmunity =` false by default. If immunity should be used or not.
+ `ignoreabs = iabs =` false by default. If absorbation should be ignored or not.
+ `percentage=p=` false by default. If true it uses the amount as percent.
+ `pcur=pc=` false by fault. Need that percentage=true. If pc is true is use the percent of current health if false it use percent dmg of maxhealth.
+ `rdbd=` if used the damage of the skill is reduced by blockdistance. Ex: rdbd=0.01 reduces the damage by 1% per block.

# Conditions


##### `- mining{action=[BOOL]||[CAST]||[CASTINSTEAD]}`
**Player only condition** Check if the player is digging into a block. Aliases ismining, digging, isdigging.

##### `- achievement{achievement=[ACHIEVEMENTNAME]||[ARRAY];action=[BOOL]||[CAST]||[CASTINSTEAD]}`
**Player only condition** Check if the player has the defined achievement or achievements.
+ achievement=ach=achievements: valid achievement entry or an array.
[valid achievements](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Achievement.html)

##### `- advancement{advancement=[ADV_KEY]||[ADV_KEY_ARRAY];action=[BOOL]||[CAST]||[CASTINSTEAD]}`
**Player only condition** Check if the player has the defined advancement or advancements.
+ advancement=adv=advancements: valid advancement entry or an array.
[valid advancements](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Advancements)

##### `- motiondirection{directions=[MOTIONDIRECTIONTPYE]||[MOTIONDIRECTIONTYPES];store=[BOOL];action=[BOOL]||[CAST]||[CASTINSTEAD]}`
**Conditions** && **TargetConditions** Checks in which direction the entity is moving to. Regardless its eyedirection. Possible directions:
LEFT, FORWARD_LEFT, FORWARD, FORWARD_RIGHT, RIGHT, BACKWARD_RIGHT, BACKWARD, BACKWARD_LEFT or leave blank for any. The directions can also be in a list like: left,forward_left,forward_right

##### `- comparenbt{nbt=[NBT]||ANY;action=[BOOL]||[CAST]||[CASTINSTEAD]}`
Use as **Conditions** && **TargetConditions** Check the nbt more advanced than testfor can do. With the ability to ignore nbt by adding **id:ignore** or use ranged values **"rd:1to5"** or **"rd:>0"** or **rd:<1** or simple a usual value like **1** Please use "(" && ")" instead of "{" && "}" for compatibility issues. Look at the examples:
Ex: `- cmpnbt{nbt=(Fire:"rd:>50")}` condition is true if the entity is on fire for more than 50 ticks.

While `getbowtension`check the strength while the bow is drawn, `lastbowtension` get the last strength of the entity's bowtension if there was any. To add skills ot the entity while draw the bow use getbowtension, if the entity shoot the bow use lastbowtension to get the strength the arrow is fired.

##### `- infaction{faction=[STRING]or[ARRAY];action=[BOOLEAN]}`
Determines if the caster or target (if used in TargetConditions) is in the faction or in one of the factions if used as array. Any mythicmobs
variable avail at runtime can be used. Eg: `faction=<mob.stance>`

##### `- lookatme{fov=[double];yo=[double];debug=[boolean]}`
##### `- looksatme{fov=[double];yo=[double];debug=[boolean]}`
  
This condition can determine if the target is looking at the caster. Therefor a **field-of-view-ratio** defined in fov as a double is used. For normal sized entities a fov-ratio of **1.999D** (used by default) is a good value to use. You can also adjust the Yoffset by define **yo**. For the standard sized entities a yo of **-0.4D** (used by default) is a good value. Usually the default offsets working very well on almost all entities. But if you need to adjust them, you can set **debug=true** and if the condition is used the fov and vecY offsets are written into the console. With that info you can easy adjust the values to your need.

*Example:*

```yaml
mobfile:

WeepingMonkey:
  Health: 500
  Type: zombie
  Display: "Weeping Monkey"
  Skills:
  - skill{s=freeze} @pir{r=32} ~onTimer:20
  
skillfile:

freeze:
  Conditions:
  - isstunned{action=false}

  - infront{view=45}
  - lookatme
  Skills:
  - stun{d=60;facing=true} @self
```

##### `- relativedirection{angle=[RANGEDVALUE];action=[BOOLEAN]}`
Use this condition to determinate the relative direction to the target. Use this condition in **TargetConditions**. Where 180 is the right side. 90 degree is straight infront and 270 degrees are exact behind. If you use `angle=0to180` the it compares if the target comes from infront, where `angle=90to270` means the targeted entity is somewhere on the right side of the caster. etc...

*Example:*

```yaml
skillfile:

    targetsonleft:
      TargetConditions:
      - relativedirection{angle=>315}
      - relativedirection{angle=<45}

# Targeters
#### If you want to use the customtargeters, you need atleast MythicMobs 4.3 or if you only have the lastest release, you need a patched 4.2. Place this jar in your pluginsfolder and restart your server. It will patch all the necessary things in MythicMobs to use CustomTargeters. https://github.com/BerndiVader/MythicMobsPatcher
